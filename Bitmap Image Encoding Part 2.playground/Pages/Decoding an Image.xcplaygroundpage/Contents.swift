/*:
 ## Decoding the text
 Now we will (at last!) decode the image.
 
 Recall, our rules are:
 
 * If a line starts with a 0, the first pixel is black.
 * If a line does not start with a 0, the first pixel is white.
 * When a comma is encountered, a new number begins, and the colour switches.
 * When a newline character is encountered, go to a new row in the image.
 * Once we have a new number, we draw that many pixels in the current colour.
 
 First, copy and paste your encoded image string to this page.

 ### Check the results
 Does the output match what you'd expect, based on the values in the encoded string?
 
 How do you know?
 
 Write your ideas in the code comment below.

/*:
 ## Extension
 Now that you have an understanding of how if statements (also called *selection* statements or *conditional* statements) work... extend this code.
 
 How could you adjust the rules so that pixels can be rendered in colour?
 
 What additions or changes would you need to make to the code above?
 
 Work with a partner to discuss possibilities and then make the changes in code.
